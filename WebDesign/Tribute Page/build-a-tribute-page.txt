					<h2>What is Rickrolling?</h2>
					
					<p>Rickrolling is an internet meme that involves tricking people into clicking on a hyperlink that leads to the music video for Rick Astley's 1987 song "Never Gonna Give You Up." The meme is a bait-and-switch, where victims are led to believe they are clicking on a relevant link but are surprised with the music video instead. The meme originated from the 4chan website's practice of "duckrolling" and gained mainstream attention in 2008. It has been used in various public events, and the song's popularity has been revitalized by its meme status.</p>

					<h2>A Brief History of Rickrolling</h2>
						
						<h3>Origin and Evolution:</h3>
						<p>The roots of rickrolling can be traced back to the early days of internet culture. The concept emerged from the practice of "duckrolling" on 4chan, where users would post misleading links leading to an image of a duck on wheels, instead of the expected content. In 2007, the practice evolved into rickrolling, where users began tricking others into clicking links that promised one thing but led to the music video for Rick Astley's 1987 song "Never Gonna Give You Up.</p>
						
						<h3>Early Instances and Rapid Spread:</h3>
						<p>In March 2007, an early instance of rickrolling occurred when a user on 4chan posted a link claiming to be a trailer for the highly anticipated video game Grand Theft Auto IV. Instead, users were redirected to the music video.The bait-and-switch technique quickly gained popularity on 4chan, especially on April Fools' Day in 2007. It expanded to other websites and internet communities.As the meme spread, people started using rickrolling in various creative ways, including disguising the links within seemingly unrelated content.</p>
						
						<h3>Mainstream Recognition:</h3>
						<p>By 2008, rickrolling had become widely recognized, catching the attention of mainstream media. It was featured in news articles and discussed on television shows. The New York Mets baseball team embraced the meme by allowing fans to vote for their eighth-inning rally song, resulting in "Never Gonna Give You Up" being played at games. YouTube's 2008 April Fools' joke involved links on the site's homepage leading to the music video, further solidifying the meme's presence in pop culture.</p>
						
						<h3>Astley's Involvement:</h3>
						<p>Despite the meme's rise, Rick Astley initially maintained a detached stance, finding the phenomenon amusing but not actively engaging with it. In November 2008, Astley appeared at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and performed "Never Gonna Give You Up" on a float, marking a significant rickrolling event. This event showcased Astley's willingness to embrace the meme.</p>
						
						<h3>Continued Influence and Resurgence:</h3>
						<p>Rickrolling remained a recurring internet meme throughout the 2010s. It continued to be referenced in various media, from TV shows to movies. The meme saw a resurgence in the early 2020s, with online classes during the COVID-19 lockdown providing a new platform for rickrolling. The music video for "Never Gonna Give You Up" reached 1 billion views on YouTube in 2021, reaffirming the song's iconic status.</p>
						
						<h3>Legacy and Cultural Impact:</h3>
