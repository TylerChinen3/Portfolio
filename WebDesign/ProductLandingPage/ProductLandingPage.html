		<h2>Birth of TCGs (1990s)</h2>
		
		<p>The origin of Trading Card Games can be traced to the release of "Magic: The Gathering" (MTG) in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast. MTG, designed by Richard Garfield, revolutionized tabletop gaming by introducing the concept of collectible, customizable card games. Players constructed decks from a pool of cards and engaged in strategic duels. The success of MTG inspired a wave of interest in TCGs, with companies like Pok√©mon (1996) and Yu-Gi-Oh! (1999) quickly entering the scene.</p>

		<h2>Rapid Growth (Late 1990s-2000s)</h2>

		<p>The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed the rapid expansion of TCGs. Competitive play and tournaments became prominent, offering substantial prizes. The internet facilitated card trading and the emergence of online TCGs. TCGs diversified into various themes and genres, with digital versions like "Hearthstone" (2014) further popularizing the genre.</p>

		<h2>Evolution and Formats</h2>

		<p>TCGs evolved over time, introducing new gameplay mechanics and formats to keep the experience engaging. Formats such as "Standard," "Commander," and "Draft" added depth and variety to gameplay. The secondary market for rare and valuable cards also grew, with card collecting and trading becoming integral to the TCG culture.</p>

		<h2>Continued Innovation (Ongoing)</h2>

		<p>TCGs continue to innovate and adapt to the ever-changing gaming landscape. New games, expansions, and digital adaptations are released regularly, maintaining the genre's popularity among both physical and digital gaming communities. The history of TCGs is marked by their enduring appeal, from their humble beginnings with MTG to their ongoing evolution in today's gaming world.</p>
